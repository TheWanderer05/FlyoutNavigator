// --- THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT (currently) INTERFACE WITH THE GAME. IT IS A STANDALONE APPLICATION. --- //

How to use:
-Enter lat/lon coordinates in the text fields.

-Optionally, you may choose a number of midpoints. Use of these is highly recommended, as your bearing between points will change as you travel. 5 is a good starting number.

-Click the 'Calculate' button.

-Two tables will populate. The first displays the total range of the trip and the range between each point.

-The second table displays the coordinates of each point, and the heading you should follow to get to the next point.

-The map will also become populated with points. The point you start at is green, and the destination point is red. The midpoints are pink.

-You may also import data from your game's AreaData file. Click the 'Import AreaData' button. Then, enable hidden files in the file browser.

-Navigate to C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\LocalLow\Stonext Games\Flyout\AreaData, and select the text file.

-The dropdown options will populate, and selecting any airfield will auto-populate the text input fields with the coordinates of said airfield.
